# 🧠 Multiple Regression using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project implements a **Multiple Regression model , decision tree, K neighbors algorithm** on a dataset with features:
- **Age**
- **Experience**
- **Salary**

The objective is to predict the **Salary** based on a person's **Age** and **Years of Experience**.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains three columns:

| Age | Experience | Salary |
|-----|------------|--------|
| 25  | 1          | 40000  |
| 30  | 3          | 50000  |
| ... | ...        | ...    |

## 🧪 Model Used

- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision tree, Multiple regression
- **Type**: Regression

## 🔧 How it works

1. Load the dataset (CSV or manual data).
2. Split into **features (X)** and **target (y)**.
3. Use `train_test_split` to divide into training and testing sets.
4. Fit model.
5. Evaluate performance using R² Score or MAE.
